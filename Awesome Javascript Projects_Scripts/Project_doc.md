<h3><b>Github DP Loader</b></h3><hr>

Small project made using javascript which shows github dp on entering github username in the input field. Made with [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) which helps in calling the github API enabling us to fetch user data including the url of their dp which is then shown on the screen.
