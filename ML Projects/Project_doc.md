<h3><b>Score Checker 📝</b></h3><hr>
I made this project for improving my accuracy while has been using random forest regressor
by passing different parameters .<br><br>
code is
easy to read and even you add more parameters and techniques in it by just having basic knowledge of python.
<br><br>
<h3>how to use score checker</h3>
<ol>
 <li>save "score checker" in your local directory (where you create your machine learning project)</li>
 <Li> import "score checker.py" as local library</li>
 <li>call function "score_model" form library</li>
 <li> pass 5 arguments i.e
  <ul>
   <li>model</li><li>x_train</li><li>x_test</li><li>y_train</li><li>y_test</li></ul>
 <li> And you get standard Mean Absolute Error as score</li>
  </ol>

<h3> Modeling Earthquake Damage 🌏🌍🌎</h3><hr>
Based on aspects of building location and construction, your goal is to predict the level of damage to buildings caused by the<br><br>
 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal.The data was collected through surveys by Kathmandu Living Labs and the Central Bureau of Statistics, which works under the National Planning Commission Secretariat of Nepal. This survey is one of the largest post-disaster datasets ever collected, containing valuable information on earthquake impacts, household conditions, and socio-economic-demographic statistics.
